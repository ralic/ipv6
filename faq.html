  <h1 id="title">test-ipv6.com FAQ</h1>

  <div class="question">
    Q: How does this test work?
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    The test is entirely client-side javascript. To determine reachability, a series of ajax requests are made from the web server, using various DNS names that force the use of IPv6 only, or dual stack, or other such scenarios. The pass/fail of such fetches, as well as how long they take, are taken into account.
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    Q: Why is this web site reachable via IPv4 only?
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    You're right, there are no AAAA records, intentionally. A percentage of users are unable to browse sites that are dual-stack. If the users can't connect, then they can't be told they have a problem. This is a big problem facing content providers today; of which, I work at one for my &#36;dayjob. As such, the main test page requires IPv4 (either native or translated).
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    At some point, when the percentage of "broken" users has gone significantly down, I'll consider making test-ipv6.com dual-stack. At last check, March 2017, we still see 0.2% broken visiting test-ipv6.com. And we still want them to understand their situation.
  </div>

  <div class="question">
   Q: I run a production IPv6-only network. Without IPv4. My users can't reach test-ipv6.com.
  </div>
  
  <div class="answer">
   Send email to jfesler@test-ipv6.com. If your IPv6-only network has dedicated name servers, or a dedicated BGP ASN, jfesler will enable AAAA records for test-ipv6.com for you.
  </div>

  <div class="answer"> 
   If you don't meet the above requirements, you can visit http://ipv6.test-ipv6.com (IPv6-only) or http://ds.test-ipv6.com (IPv4+IPv6).
  </div>


  <div class="question">
    Q: What do you mean by broken?
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    A percentage of users today have IPv6 enabled, but are either using a public tunnel that is currently giving poor performance; or otherwise have a route that is installed but broken or suboptimal. However, because they have a route at all, in many cases the address selection algorithm of RFC3484 will pick using it, and trying to use this broken route. It can take towards 75+ seconds before the browser gives up!
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    From the perspective of a user with these conditions, a web site offering both A and AAAA DNS records (ie, "dual stack") will appear to time out; and the user will move on to another site that offers a similar product. This is the quandary content providers have.
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    If we detect that you will have problems reaching dual-stack web sites, we recommend you see the <a href="broken.html">Broken User FAQ</a>. It provides several steps to try and identify your root cause for being broken; and barring that, what you can do to disable IPv6 until your ISP offers native IPv6 connectivity.
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    Q: Why did your stats say you already have IPv6-only users?
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    They went to <a href="http://ipv6.test-ipv6.com">http://ipv6.test-ipv6.com</a> .
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    Q: How valid are the stats?
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    They do not represent the average web consumer. Visitors to this site are self-selecting. The intent of this site is to not provide stats, but instead to inform the user the level of readiness for the world to move to IPv6 (with or without'em!). As such, stats found here will be completely different from an average content provider.
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    Q: How does your test differ, from what the content providers are doing?
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    Content providers are gathering metrics of broken vs non-broken users, in an aggregate form. They are not at this time actually giving the user feedback as to the user's current state. Those metrics will principally drive the business decision of when to start publishing sites over IPv6, versus remaining IPv4 only. IPv4 only for some content sites really is an option; it has a handful of downsides, but the expectation is that everyone will always be able to reach IPv4, in some fashion.
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    This site, on the other hand, is intended to help the user understand their current state, and what that state possibly means to them.
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    Q: Your site shows the wrong IP address; how can I bypass my proxy server to find my public address?
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    For ipv4/ipv6/dual stack, use one of these:

    <p><code>telnet ipv4.test-ipv6.com 79</code> for ipv4<br />
    <code>telnet ipv6.test-ipv6.com 79</code> for ipv6<br />
    <code>telnet ds.test-ipv6.com 79</code> for either</p>

    <p>Note you _may_ need to specify other options to your telnet command, depending on your operating system. On my mac, for example, I need to use "<code>telnet -6</code>".</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    Q: Do you actually read the feedback?
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    Yes, I do. Thank you! Note that I can only follow up with you if you do leave contact information. While I am still grateful for feedback without contact information, I will be unable to reply with any answers if you asked for them.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    Q: How else can I contact you?
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    I would prefer you use the form, as it gives details of your connectivity, and bypasses any mail filters.
    That said, you are welcome to directly email <a href="mailto:jfesler@test-ipv6.com">jfesler@test-ipv6.com</a>.
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    Q: Is this open source?
  </div>
  
  <div class="answer">
    Yes. See the <a href="source.html">source page</a> for details.
  </div>
